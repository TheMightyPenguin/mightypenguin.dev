# Animating SVG paths with CSS

<SvgPathExample />

First, measure your `path` element length using JS, you can do this by running this in the browser console:

```js
Math.ceil(
  document.querySelector('your-path-element-selector').getTotalLength(),
);
```

> Note: We apply `Math.ceil` as this will likely be a floating point number and we round it up to make it easier to work with.

Take a note of that number, for the `path` above the value is `827` so we'll use that in the example but replace it with yours. Now add the following CSS:

```css
@keyframes draw-path {
  0%   { strokeDashoffset: 0 },
  50%  { strokeDashoffset: -827 },
  100% { strokeDashoffset: 0 },
}

.your-path-selector {
  stroke-dashoffset: -pathLength;
  transition: stroke-dashoffset 200ms ease;
  animation: draw-path 6s infinite;
}
```

And that's it, it looks like the line it's being drawn on the screen.

You can also add a `stroke-dasharray` and get a different effect:

<SvgPathExample strokeDasharray="20 0 10" />
