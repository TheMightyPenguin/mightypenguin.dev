# Locking body scroll

When we show an overlay-like UI (Modal, ...) it's common that we want to lock the body scroll, to prevent users from interacting with it while this UI is open.

To accomplish this, we need to take a few things into consideration as applying `body { overflow: hidden; }` won't be enough as this doesn't work on iOS Safari.

We could solve this on our own, but there are a few great libraries that solve this issue and handle the edge cases

There's a [great article comparing libraries](https://medium.com/react-camp/how-to-fight-the-body-scroll-2b00267b37ac) by [@theKashey](https://twitter.com/theKashey) that solve this problem, including a few React specific options:

Out of these, `scroll-lock` is a great Vanilla JS option and can be easily integrated with React, but https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll seems like it's worth checking out.

```jsx
import { disablePageScroll, enablePageScroll } from 'scroll-lock';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const nodeRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    disablePageScroll(nodeRef.current);

    return () => {
      enablePageScroll(nodeRef.current);
    };
  }, [nodeRef]);

  // return JSX
};
```
