# Vercel Countdown Clock

My first approach was using AnimatePresence, then a collection of `motion.span`'s inside, one per digit.

After some time with this approach, I quickly realized that for this approach to work, we need to know the number of digits we want to display beforehand.

So After inspecting Vercel implementation, I realized they were always rendering 2 divs. I wondered why, and after some tinkering I realized that if the component is rendering 2 divs, then it can be flexible and we don't need to know the number of digits we want to render beforehand.
